Poverty Trivia is an app designed to help people open their eyes to the realities of poverty in New Mexico and around the United States. 

Users answer as many true/false and multiple choice questions regarding poverty as they can until they get two wrong in a row.
The users score is calculated by taking the summation of their current streak of correct questions.

Poverty Trivia uses data from census.gov and kidscount.org. 
The data includes median income, unemployment figures, and general poverty rates around New Mexico and the United States.
